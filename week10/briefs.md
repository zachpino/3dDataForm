### Final Briefs

You have a choice in your final brief. Select one of the following projects and complete the deliverables by our final critique date (12/08). Your proposal will be evaluated on concept, ambition, *research rigor*, and execution.

Perfected resolution and fidelity are much less important than *demonstrated and consistent effort, perseverence, and broad exploration*. These projects are inherently experimental and future looking, and will likely lead to more questions and many new directions in their  resolution. We are producing proposals and novel ideas for *future methods of designing*, and not intending to produce fully resolved final results just yet. 

Students should expect to order some supplies for this project -- if ambitions are high and costs are onerous, let Zach know.

> Unified Brief Requirements
> - The final process must involve at least 2 digital fabrication technologies in their presentation (laser-cutting, 3d printing, CNC machining)
> - An annotated Grasshopper file should be made available that is legible to an amateur user of the program

#### Brief 1 - Parametric Products (New Human Factors, Inclusive Design, and Service Design Focus)

Envision how a future service could make use of costumer data to *create a customized object for each and every individual*. Devise a Grasshopper or otherwise programmatic method for converting select user information into an output form that reflects their uniqueness. The Grasshopper file should be capable of generating an effectively infinite number of final outputs, comporting with the variability of human kind.

The ingested data could be at the user-level (bodily measurements, preferred colors...) or environment-level (room layout and dimensions, geolocation...), or grander (could a sovereign country be a user of such a service?).

After the Grasshopper file is created, how might we talk about the value proposition of such a product offering in an otherwise regressive marketplace?

> Deliverables
>- Suite of at least 3 physical variations of the final objects (in as realistic materiality and scale as possible) demonstrating the expressiveness of the parametric service
>- Project documentation through a sequence of annotated photographs 
>- Storyboard of images demonstrating how a customer would engage with the service
>- Pitch deck, or website prototype, describing the value proposition of the embryonic service, along with how the outputted objects vary between customers.
>- Single layout, 18"x24", detailing the project (doesn't need to be printed, should be legible when projected)

#### Brief 2 - Grown Forms (AI Design, Design Research, Biomimetic Form Focus)
Create or borrow an algorithmic model for how some specific natural entity grows (L-Systems would be a natural fit, though their are other models). Devise a way to recreate this growth programmatically in form or surface, and envision some real-world applications for the resulting structure.

How can generated forms provide emergent and unexpected properties to designed outcomes?

> Deliverables
>- Suite of at least 3 experiments demonstrating how the structure grows into and over different geometries 
>- Project documentation through a sequence of annotated photographs 
>- Storyboard of images demonstrating how the structure grows and maps to underlying or environmental obstructions
>- Proposal document detailing how the growth as designed could be scoped and applied to a set of real-life commercial, exploratory, or aesthetic applications
>- Single layout, 18"x24", detailing the project (doesn't need to be printed, should be legible when projected)

#### Brief 3 - Data Storytelling (Data Visualization, Data Journalism, and Communication Focus)
Select a set of complementary datasets about an engaging issue, and help a user more fully understand that issue, and the designer's opinion of the issue, in all of its specificity by embedding that information in a suite of interactive, 3-dimensional objects. Ideally, the objects tell their own story in materiality, form, and surface -- though if necessary, textual accompaniments can be included to more fully round-out the experience.

How can physical objects help observers better engage and understand complex data?

> Deliverables
>- Collection of at least 3 data-derived forms
>- Project documentation through a sequence of annotated photographs 
>- Designed legend to accompany the objects, detailing how to read the forms
>- Presentation deck on the issue, priming a person unfamiliar with the issue to get the most out of the data-derived object experience
>- Single layout, 18"x24", detailing the project (doesn't need to be printed, should be legible when projected)

#### Brief 4 - Simulated and Evolved Performance (Engineering and Fabrication Focus)
Define a specific design goal relating to physical performance. Recreate the scenario in an accurate simulation environment, and use learnings from the simulation to hone an object towards the goal, optionally integrating evolutionary modeling. The simulation must take into account the materiality of the object and as many parts of the eventual form as is feasible. 

How can computational tools enable more performative designed outcomes? 

> Deliverables
>- Final, testable object (in as realistic materiality and scale as possible) embodying the learnings derived from the simulation
>- Physical simulation method as a control to evaluate computational simulation and outcomes
>- Project documentation through a sequence of annotated photographs 
>- Storyboard of images detailing the simulation and how it shapes form
>- Single layout, 18"x24", detailing the project (doesn't need to be printed, should be legible when projected)

-----

#### Brief 5 - Formal Exploration (Choose your own adventure!)
Envision a scenario wherein some of the algorithmic tools (programmatic form, simulated form, evolved form, AI-derived algorithmic form, generatively grown form, data-embedded form) that we have discussed could be applied in a designed object, service, or experience.

> Deliverables
>- Final deliverables and requirements will be scoped in conversation with Zach.
