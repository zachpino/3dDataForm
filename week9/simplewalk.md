### Simple Walker in Python

[Agent-Based Modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model) is in many ways the opposite of the evolutionary form finding and simulated formal development discussed to date. Rather than the designer thinking about a final outcome to minimize or maximize, an agent-based modeling approach allows the designers to specifically define the parameters and abilities of an agent â€” and then observe that agent exist and generate autonomously. An individual is defined, and then outcomes emerge. Designing in this way is often termed *Generative Design* because the design in many ways *generates* itself.

This script can be placed inside of a Python node in Grasshopper, with inputs for

        x: The x script variable
        y: The y script variable
    Output:
        a: The a output variable"""
