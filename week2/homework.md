### Homework

- Continue practicing programmatic SVG creation and editing. Fallback to Illustrator/Sketch as necessary.
- Get some experimentation with the `<path d="">` drawing language. Draw an elephant with code.
- Begin testing the various laser cutting materials as assigned in class. Attempt to find reliable settings for cutting, rastering, and engraving.
- Due in 3 weeks (9/23) will be the first brief, the interlocking puzzle project. Begin drawing your forms by hand if you haven't already, and try to get some of them into svg and/or javascript. The lasercut puzzle pieces should compose into a recognizable flat geometry (circle, square, polygon) and decompose into individual pieces of your own design. 3-dimensional construction, semi-permanent interlocking, flexing, and kinetic mechanisms will be discussed next week, along with an additional requirement of a container for your puzzle pieces. *At least half of the pieces should be drawn in code*
- Purchase a [Rhinoceros 3D Single-Use Student License](https://www.rhino3d.com/store?audience=Educational) for your platform of choice for $195. Also bring in any simple [2-button mouse](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Wireless-Mouse-M185-910-002225/dp/B004YAVF8I/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&qid=1504281935&sr=8-9&keywords=mouse) every class going forward.
