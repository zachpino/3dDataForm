  ### Week 2 Â· Programmatic 2D SVG
  
[Scalable Vector Graphics](http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/svg) are a powerful method for drawing interactive, animated, complex shapes in a web browser.

The language itself is remarkably simple, though expressive. This chunk of code creates an svg canvas (work area) 600px by 600px, with a circle positioned at 50px, 100px and a radius of 30px.

```svg
<svg width='600' height='600'>

  <circle cx="50" cy="100" r="30" />

</svg>
```
