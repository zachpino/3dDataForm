### Field Lines 

[Field analysis and field lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_line) serve as computational simulations for many natural phenomena including fluid flow, magnetic and electric behavior, erosion, and kinetic particulates like fireworks and fine powder dispersion.

Grasshopper offers helpful utilities for field analysis.

This setup attempts to simulate a waterfall.
- A boundary rectangle is drawn
- The top edge of the boundary rectangle is divided into many parts to serve as water emmitters
- A vector force pulls water down from the emmitters, simulating the force of gravity
- Random point charges emulate rocks obstructing the stream,
